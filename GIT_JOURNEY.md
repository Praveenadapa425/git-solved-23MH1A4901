## Conflicts Resolved

### Merge 1: main + dev (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Production used port 8080, development used 3000
- **Resolution**: Created unified config with environment-based settings
- **Strategy**: Keep production as default, add dev as optional
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: Different database hosts and SSL modes
- **Resolution**: Created separate profiles for production and development
- **Strategy**: Restructured JSON to support both environments
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: Different deployment strategies (production vs docker-compose)
- **Resolution**: Added conditional logic based on DEPLOY_ENV variable
- **Strategy**: Made script handle both environments dynamically
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: Different monitoring intervals and log formats
- **Resolution**: Environment-based configuration object
- **Strategy**: Used process.env.NODE_ENV to determine behavior
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Different architectural descriptions
- **Resolution**: Merged both descriptions into comprehensive document
- **Strategy**: Created sections for each environment
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: Different feature lists and version numbers
- **Resolution**: Combined all features with clear environment labels
- **Strategy**: Organized features by category
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

### Merge 2: main + conflict-simulator (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: A stable production/development config conflicted with an experimental version adding advanced features like AI and multi-cloud support.
- **Resolution**: I created a unified configuration file with a new `experimental_features` block, which is controlled by a master `enabled: false` flag.
- **Strategy**: This approach keeps the production configuration safe and stable by default, while still preserving all the new experimental features in a structured, disabled state, ready for future testing.
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 25 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: A simple two-profile (production/dev) database config conflicted with an enterprise-grade distributed database setup.
- **Resolution**: I restructured the JSON to have three distinct profiles: `production`, `development`, and `experimental`, each containing a complete and separate configuration.
- **Strategy**: By creating separate profiles, the application can select the correct database setup for the environment. This keeps production simple while fully documenting the complex, scalable architecture for future use.
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: A straightforward two-environment deploy script conflicted with a complex script for AI-powered, multi-cloud canary deployments.
- **Resolution**: I merged them into a single, powerful script using an `if-elif-else` structure to create separate execution paths for `production`, `development`, and `experimental` environments.
- **Strategy**: The script defaults to the safe `production` mode. The advanced experimental logic is completely isolated in its own block, ensuring that cutting-edge features do not interfere with stable, mission-critical deployments.
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 30 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: A standard monitoring script conflicted with an experimental version that added AI-powered predictive analysis and anomaly detection.
- **Resolution**: I integrated the new AI features into the existing script but placed them inside conditional logic that is only activated if a `config.experimental_mode` flag is true.
- **Strategy**: This enhances the script's capabilities without activating potentially unstable features by default, thereby maintaining backward compatibility while allowing for future innovation.
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Simple microservice documentation conflicted with a document describing a highly advanced, event-driven, multi-cloud architecture.
- **Resolution**: I combined both documents into a single, unified file with clearly labeled sections for "Current Production Architecture" and "Experimental Architecture (Future Vision)".
- **Strategy**: This creates a single source of truth that documents both the current, stable state of the system and provides a clear roadmap for its future evolution.
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: The standard project README conflicted with an experimental version focused on AI features.
- **Resolution**: I created a new, unified README that includes my student info, a prominent `⚠️ Warning` section about experimental features, and combined feature lists and Quick Start guides for all three environments.
- **Strategy**: The goal was to create a clear and honest "front page" for the project that serves both regular users and developers interested in the experimental features.
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

## Most Challenging Parts

1. **Understanding Conflict Markers**: Initially confused by `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` symbols. Learned that HEAD is current branch and the other side is incoming changes.

2. **Deciding What to Keep**: Hardest part was choosing between conflicting code. Learned to read both versions completely before deciding.

3. **Complex Logic Conflicts**: deploy.sh had completely different logic. Had to understand both approaches before combining.

4. **Testing After Resolution**: Making sure resolved code actually worked was crucial.

## Key Learnings

### Technical Skills
- Mastered conflict resolution process
- Understood merge conflict markers
- Learned to use git diff effectively
- Practiced all major Git commands

### Best Practices
- Always read both sides of conflict before resolving
- Test resolved code before committing
- Write detailed merge commit messages
- Use git status frequently
- Commit atomically

### Git Workflow Insights
- Conflicts are normal, not errors
- Take time to understand both changes
- When in doubt, ask for clarification
- Document your resolution strategy
- Keep calm and read carefully

## Reflection
This challenge taught me that merge conflicts aren't scary - they're 
just Git asking "which version do you want?". The key is understanding 
what each side is trying to do before combining them. I now feel 
confident handling conflicts in real projects.

The hands-on practice with all Git commands (especially rebase and 
cherry-pick) was invaluable. I understand the difference between merge 
and rebase, and when to use each. Most importantly, I learned that 
git reflog is a lifesaver!
